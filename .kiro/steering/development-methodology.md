# RiskIntel360 Development Methodology

## Overview

RiskIntel360 follows a structured three-phase development approach: **Specification-Driven Development (SDD)** → **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** → **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. This methodology ensures that every feature is properly specified, behaviorally defined, and thoroughly tested before implementation.

## Phase 1: Specification-Driven Development (SDD)

### Purpose
Define clear, measurable requirements and acceptance criteria before any code is written. All development starts with comprehensive specifications that align with AWS AI Agent Competition requirements.

### Process
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Start with user stories and acceptance criteria from `.kiro/specs/riskintel360/requirements.md`
2. **Design Documentation**: Create detailed technical design in `.kiro/specs/riskintel360/design.md`
3. **Task Breakdown**: Define implementation tasks in `.kiro/specs/riskintel360/tasks.md`
4. **Specification Review**: Validate specifications against competition criteria and business value

### Key Artifacts
- **Requirements Document**: EARS format acceptance criteria with measurable outcomes
- **Design Document**: Architecture, components, data models, and integration patterns
- **Task List**: Actionable implementation steps with requirement traceability
- **Competition Alignment**: AWS service requirements and performance targets

### Example Specification Pattern
```markdown
### Requirement: Advanced Fraud Detection Agent

**User Story**: As a security analyst, I want ML-powered fraud detection with 90% false positive reduction, so that I can prevent $10M+ annual fraud losses.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN transactions are processed THEN the system SHALL use unsupervised ML (isolation forests, autoencoders) for real-time anomaly detection
2. WHEN suspicious patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL achieve 90% reduction in false positives compared to traditional rule-based systems
3. WHEN fraud alerts are generated THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores and ML-based explanations
4. WHEN new fraud patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL automatically adapt without requiring labeled training data
```

## Phase 2: Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

### Purpose
Define expected system behavior in natural language scenarios that can be understood by both technical and business stakeholders. Focus on fintech-specific behaviors and AWS competition requirements.

### Process
1. **Scenario Definition**: Write Given-When-Then scenarios for each specification
2. **Behavior Validation**: Ensure scenarios cover all acceptance criteria
3. **Stakeholder Review**: Validate behaviors with domain experts
4. **Automation Preparation**: Structure scenarios for automated testing

### BDD Framework
Use **pytest-bdd** for Python backend and **Cucumber.js** for frontend behavior testing.

### Scenario Structure
```gherkin
Feature: Regulatory Compliance Monitoring
  As a compliance officer
  I want automated regulatory change monitoring
  So that I can ensure continuous compliance without manual oversight

  Background:
    Given the RiskIntel360 platform is deployed
    And the Regulatory Compliance Agent is active
    And public data sources (SEC, FINRA, CFPB) are accessible

  Scenario: Detect new SEC regulation
    Given a new SEC regulation is published
    When the Regulatory Compliance Agent processes the update
    Then it should analyze the impact on current operations
    And it should generate compliance recommendations
    And it should alert the compliance team within 5 minutes
    And the confidence score should be above 0.8

  Scenario: Generate compliance remediation plan
    Given a compliance gap is identified
    When the agent analyzes the regulatory requirements
    Then it should create a detailed remediation plan
    And the plan should reference public regulatory guidance
    And the plan should include implementation timeline
    And the estimated cost should be calculated
```

### BDD File Organization
```
tests/bdd/
├── features/
│   ├── regulatory_compliance.feature
│   ├── fraud_detection.feature
│   ├── risk_assessment.feature
│   ├── market_analysis.feature
│   └── kyc_verification.feature
├── step_definitions/
│   ├── regulatory_steps.py

```

### BDD Implementation Pattern
```python
# tests/bdd/step_definitions/regulatory_steps.py
from pytest_bdd import given, when, then, scenarios
from riskintel360.agents.regulatory_compliance_agent import RegulatoryComplianceAgent

scenarios('../features/regulatory_compliance.feature')

@given('the Regulatory Compliance Agent is active')
def regulatory_agent_active(regulatory_agent):
    assert regulatory_agent.is_active()
    assert regulatory_agent.get_status() == "ready"

@when('the Regulatory Compliance Agent processes the update')
def process_regulatory_update(regulatory_agent, sec_regulation_update):
    regulatory_agent.process_regulatory_change(sec_regulation_update)

@then('it should analyze the impact on current operations')
def verify_impact_analysis(regulatory_agent):
    analysis = regulatory_agent.get_latest_analysis()
    assert analysis.impact_assessment is not None
    assert analysis.confidence_score >= 0.8
    assert len(analysis.affected_operations) > 0
```

## Phase 3: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### Purpose
Write failing tests first, then implement the minimum code to make tests pass. Ensure all functionality is thoroughly tested with focus on financial accuracy and AWS competition requirements.

### TDD Cycle (Red-Green-Refactor)
1. **Red**: Write a failing test that defines desired functionality
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green

### Test Categories

#### Unit Tests
Focus on individual components and functions with financial accuracy validation.

```python
# tests/unit/test_fraud_detection_agent.py
import pytest
import numpy as np
from riskintel360.agents.fraud_detection_agent import FraudDetectionAgent
from riskintel360.services.unsupervised_ml_engine import UnsupervisedMLEngine

    def fraud_agent(self):
        return FraudDetectionAgent(config=FraudDetectionAgentConfig())
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def sample_transactions(self):
        # Generate realistic financial transaction data
        return np.random.normal(100, 20, (1000, 5))  # 1000 transactions, 5 features
    
    def test_fraud_detection_accuracy_requirement(self, fraud_agent, sample_transactions):

        result = fraud_agent.detect_fraud(sample_transactions)
        
        # Verify competition requirement: 90% false positive reduction
        assert result.false_positive_rate < 0.1  # 90% reduction from typical 10% baseline
        assert result.confidence_score >= 0.8
        assert len(result.anomalous_indices) > 0
    
    def test_real_time_processing_requirement(self, fraud_agent, sample_transactions):

        import time
        
        start_time = time.time()
        result = fraud_agent.detect_fraud(sample_transactions)
        processing_time = time.time() - start_time
        
        # Verify competition requirement: < 5 second response time
        assert processing_time < 5.0
        assert result is not None
    
    def test_unsupervised_ml_integration(self, fraud_agent):

```

## Development Workflow Integration

### 1. Start with Specification (SDD)
```bash
# Review and validate specifications
kiro spec review riskintel360
# Ensure all requirements have acceptance criteria
# Validate against AWS competition requirements
```

### 2. Define Behaviors (BDD)
```bash
# Create behavior scenarios
pytest --collect-only tests/bdd/
# Validate scenario coverage
pytest-bdd --gherkin-terminal-reporter tests/bdd/
```

### 3. Implement with Tests (TDD)
```bash
# Run failing tests first (Red)
pytest tests/unit/test_fraud_detection_agent.py::test_fraud_detection_accuracy_requirement -v

# Implement minimal code (Green)
# Write FraudDetectionAgent.detect_fraud() method

# Verify tests pass (Green)
pytest tests/unit/test_fraud_detection_agent.py::test_fraud_detection_accuracy_requirement -v

# Refactor and improve (Refactor)
# Optimize performance while keeping tests green
```

### 4. Continuous Validation
```bash
# Run all test categories
pytest -m unit                    # Fast unit tests
pytest -m integration            # Component integration tests  
pytest -m e2e                   # End-to-end workflow tests
pytest -m competition           # AWS competition specific tests
pytest -m performance          # Performance benchmarks
```
