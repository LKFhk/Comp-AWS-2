Feature: End-to-End Fintech Intelligence Workflows
  As a fintech executive
  I want complete end-to-end fintech intelligence workflows with measurable business value
  So that I can make comprehensive strategic decisions with quantified ROI

  Background:
    Given the complete RiskIntel360 platform is operational
    And all fintech data sources are connected and accessible
    And the workflow orchestrator is ready for multi-agent coordination

  Scenario: Comprehensive fintech risk intelligence analysis
    Given a fintech company requests comprehensive risk intelligence analysis
    When the complete fintech workflow is executed
    Then all five fintech agents should participate in the analysis
    And comprehensive risk intelligence should be generated
    And the workflow should complete within 2 hours
    And business value should be quantified and reported
    And the confidence score should be above 0.8

  Scenario: Real-time multi-agent coordination for urgent scenarios
    Given multiple urgent fintech scenarios occur simultaneously
    When the system coordinates real-time multi-agent response
    Then high-priority scenarios should be addressed first
    And agent coordination should be seamless and efficient
    And response times should meet emergency SLA requirements
    And the system should maintain 99.9% uptime

  Scenario: Business value demonstration for regional bank
    Given a financial institution wants to evaluate RiskIntel360 ROI
    When comprehensive business value analysis is performed
    Then ROI should exceed 5.0x within 18 months
    And annual cost savings should exceed $3000000
    And fraud prevention value should be quantified and substantial
    And compliance automation benefits should be demonstrated

  Scenario: Performance under high concurrent load
    Given the system handles 10 concurrent complete workflows
    When all workflows are executed simultaneously under load
    Then all workflows should complete successfully
    And system performance should remain within acceptable limits
    And resource utilization should be optimized
    And the system should maintain 99.9% uptime

  Scenario: Cross-agent intelligence synthesis and validation
    Given multiple agents have completed their individual analyses
    When the system synthesizes cross-agent intelligence
    Then it should identify correlations and conflicts between agent findings
    And it should provide consolidated risk and opportunity assessments
    And it should validate findings through cross-agent verification
    And synthesis should complete within 30 minutes
    And overall confidence should reflect cross-validation results

  Scenario: Adaptive workflow optimization based on company profile
    Given companies with different profiles (startup vs enterprise) request analysis
    When the system adapts workflows based on company characteristics
    Then it should customize analysis depth and focus areas
    And it should optimize resource allocation based on company size and needs
    And it should provide appropriate recommendations for each company type
    And adaptation should not significantly impact processing time

  Scenario: Continuous learning and model improvement
    Given the system has processed multiple workflows over time
    When the system analyzes workflow performance and outcomes
    Then it should identify patterns in successful vs unsuccessful analyses
    And it should recommend model improvements and parameter adjustments
    And it should adapt agent coordination strategies based on historical performance
    And learning insights should be incorporated into future workflows

  Scenario: Disaster recovery and business continuity
    Given critical system components may experience failures
    When the system encounters component failures during workflow execution
    Then it should implement graceful degradation strategies
    And it should maintain core functionality using backup systems
    And it should complete workflows with reduced but acceptable quality
    And recovery should be automatic and transparent to users

  Scenario: Regulatory compliance across workflow execution
    Given workflows must maintain regulatory compliance throughout execution
    When the system executes workflows with sensitive financial data
    Then it should maintain data privacy and security standards
    And it should generate audit trails for all processing steps
    And it should ensure compliance with financial services regulations
    And compliance verification should be integrated into workflow completion

  Scenario: Scalable value generation across company sizes
    Given companies ranging from startups to large enterprises request analysis
    When the system generates value propositions for different company sizes
    Then small companies should see $50000+ annual value generation
    And medium companies should see $1000000+ annual value generation  
    And large companies should see $10000000+ annual value generation
    And value scaling should be proportional to company size and complexity
