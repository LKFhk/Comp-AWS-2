Feature: KYC Verification and Customer Due Diligence
  As a compliance officer at a financial institution
  I want automated KYC verification with risk-based decision making
  So that I can efficiently onboard customers while maintaining regulatory compliance

  Background:
    Given the RiskIntel360 platform is deployed
    And the KYC Verification Agent is active
    And identity verification services are accessible
    And sanctions lists and public records are up-to-date

  Scenario: Individual customer KYC verification
    Given a new individual customer requires KYC verification
    When the KYC Verification Agent processes the customer information
    Then identity documents should be validated automatically
    And sanctions screening should be performed
    And risk scoring should be calculated based on multiple factors
    And verification should complete within 2 minutes
    And the confidence score should be above 0.8

  Scenario: Business entity enhanced due diligence
    Given a new business entity requires enhanced due diligence
    When the system performs enhanced due diligence
    Then beneficial ownership should be identified and verified
    And corporate structure should be analyzed
    And regulatory compliance status should be checked
    And verification should complete within 2 minutes
    And the confidence score should be above 0.8

  Scenario: Risk-based verification for high-risk customer
    Given a customer with high risk profile
    When risk-based verification procedures are applied
    Then verification depth should match the risk level
    And additional checks should be triggered for high-risk customers
    And verification should complete within 2 minutes
    And the confidence score should be above 0.8

  Scenario: Automated KYC decision making within thresholds
    Given automated KYC decision rules are configured
    When the system makes automated verification decisions
    Then decisions should be made within defined confidence thresholds
    And manual review should be flagged for edge cases
    And the system should maintain 99.9% uptime
    And processing time should be less than 2.0 seconds

  Scenario: High-volume concurrent KYC processing
    Given the system processes 30 concurrent KYC verifications
    When all KYC verifications are processed simultaneously
    Then all verifications should complete within performance requirements
    And verification accuracy should remain above 95%
    And the system should maintain 99.9% uptime
    And memory usage should remain below 512 MB

  Scenario: Compliance audit trail and reporting
    Given audit trail requirements are enabled
    When KYC verification decisions are made
    Then all decisions should be logged for audit purposes
    And compliance reports should be generated automatically
    And data retention policies should be enforced
    And the confidence score should be above 0.8

  Scenario: Cross-border KYC verification
    Given customers from multiple jurisdictions require verification
    When the system performs cross-border KYC verification
    Then it should apply jurisdiction-specific requirements
    And it should handle multiple document types and formats
    And it should perform appropriate sanctions screening for each jurisdiction
    And verification should complete within 5 minutes

  Scenario: Ongoing customer monitoring and re-verification
    Given existing customers require ongoing monitoring
    When the system performs periodic re-verification
    Then it should detect changes in customer risk profiles
    And it should trigger re-verification when risk thresholds are exceeded
    And it should maintain updated sanctions screening
    And monitoring should be performed in real-time

  Scenario: KYC data quality and completeness validation
    Given customer data with varying quality and completeness
    When the system validates KYC data quality
    Then it should identify missing or incomplete information
    And it should flag potentially fraudulent or inconsistent data
    And it should provide data quality scores and recommendations
    And validation should complete within 1 minute

  Scenario: Integration with external identity verification services
    Given multiple external identity verification providers are available
    When the system integrates with external verification services
    Then it should route verification requests to appropriate providers
    And it should aggregate results from multiple sources
    And it should provide consolidated verification decisions
    And integration should maintain performance requirements
