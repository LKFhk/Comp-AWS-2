Feature: Regulatory Compliance Monitoring and Analysis
  As a compliance officer at a fintech company
  I want automated regulatory compliance monitoring using public data sources
  So that I can ensure continuous compliance without expensive regulatory subscriptions

  Background:
    Given the RiskIntel360 platform is deployed
    And the Regulatory Compliance Agent is active
    And public regulatory data sources are accessible
    And the system monitors SEC, FINRA, CFPB, and Treasury sources

  Scenario: Detect and analyze new SEC regulation
    Given a new SEC regulation is published
    When the Regulatory Compliance Agent processes the regulatory update
    Then it should analyze the impact on current operations within 5 minutes
    And it should generate compliance recommendations with confidence > 0.8
    And it should reference public regulatory guidance
    And it should alert compliance teams with actionable insights

  Scenario: Generate compliance remediation plan for fintech startup
    Given a compliance gap is identified for a fintech startup
    When the agent analyzes regulatory requirements using public sources
    Then it should create a detailed remediation plan
    And the plan should use only free public regulatory guidance
    And the plan should include implementation timeline and cost estimates
    And the plan should be accessible to companies without expensive subscriptions

  Scenario: Real-time regulatory change monitoring
    Given the system is monitoring regulatory changes in real-time
    When a critical regulatory change occurs
    Then the system should detect the change within 5 minutes
    And compliance officers should be notified immediately
    And the analysis should include detailed explanations
    And the confidence score should be above 0.8

  Scenario: Cost-effective compliance analysis for small companies
    Given the system uses primarily free public data sources
    When compliance analysis is performed for a small fintech company
    Then the analysis cost should be under $1000
    And the solution should be accessible to startups and small businesses
    And the analysis quality should remain above 85% compared to premium data
    And cost reduction should be at least 80%

  Scenario: High-volume concurrent compliance processing
    Given the system handles 25 concurrent compliance requests
    When all compliance requests are processed simultaneously
    Then all requests should complete within the performance requirements
    And the system should maintain regulatory monitoring accuracy above 95%
    And memory usage should remain below 512 MB
    And the system should maintain 99.9% uptime

  Scenario: Multi-source regulatory intelligence fusion
    Given regulatory updates from multiple sources (SEC, FINRA, CFPB) are available
    When the agent processes updates from all sources simultaneously
    Then it should correlate related regulatory changes across sources
    And it should identify conflicting or complementary requirements
    And it should prioritize updates by business impact and urgency
    And the consolidated analysis should have confidence > 0.85

  Scenario: Automated compliance gap identification
    Given a fintech company's current compliance status
    When the system performs comprehensive compliance assessment
    Then it should identify specific compliance gaps and risks
    And it should categorize gaps by severity and regulatory deadline
    And it should provide gap-specific remediation recommendations
    And the assessment should complete within 10 minutes

  Scenario: Regulatory change impact prediction
    Given historical regulatory patterns and current business operations
    When the system analyzes potential future regulatory changes
    Then it should predict likely regulatory developments with confidence scores
    And it should assess potential business impact of predicted changes
    And it should recommend proactive compliance measures
    And predictions should be based on publicly available regulatory trends
