Feature: Comprehensive Risk Assessment and Management
  As a risk manager at a financial institution
  I want automated multi-dimensional risk assessment with real-time monitoring
  So that I can make informed decisions about risk exposure and mitigation strategies

  Background:
    Given the RiskIntel360 platform is deployed
    And the Risk Assessment Agent is active
    And risk models and market data are available
    And historical market data for backtesting is accessible

  Scenario: Multi-dimensional portfolio risk analysis
    Given a portfolio requires comprehensive risk assessment
    When the Risk Assessment Agent analyzes all risk dimensions
    Then credit risk assessment should be provided
    And market risk metrics should include VaR calculations
    And operational risk factors should be evaluated
    And regulatory risk should be assessed
    And overall risk score should be calculated
    And risk assessment should complete within 10 minutes

  Scenario: Market crash stress testing
    Given stress testing scenarios for market_crash events
    When stress testing is performed on the portfolio
    Then portfolio impact should be quantified
    And worst-case scenario losses should be estimated
    And recovery time should be projected
    And the confidence score should be above 0.8
    And risk assessment should complete within 10 minutes

  Scenario: Real-time risk monitoring with volatility spike
    Given real-time risk monitoring is enabled
    When market conditions change significantly (volatility_spike)
    Then risk metrics should be updated within 2 minutes
    And risk alerts should be triggered for threshold breaches
    And mitigation recommendations should be provided
    And the confidence score should be above 0.8

  Scenario: Economic scenario analysis across multiple scenarios
    Given multiple economic scenarios are defined
    When scenario analysis is performed across all scenarios
    Then risk outcomes should be calculated for each scenario
    And probability-weighted risk should be computed
    And scenario comparison should highlight key differences
    And risk assessment should complete within 10 minutes

  Scenario: High-volume concurrent risk assessment processing
    Given the system handles 15 concurrent risk assessments
    When all risk assessments are processed simultaneously
    Then all assessments should complete within performance benchmarks
    And risk calculation accuracy should remain above 90%
    And the system should maintain 99.9% uptime
    And memory usage should remain below 512 MB

  Scenario: Credit risk assessment with default probability modeling
    Given a portfolio with credit exposures across different sectors
    When the system performs credit risk assessment
    Then it should calculate probability of default for each exposure
    And it should estimate loss given default and exposure at default
    And it should provide portfolio-level credit risk metrics
    And it should identify concentration risks and correlations
    And assessment should complete within 15 minutes

  Scenario: Liquidity risk assessment and stress testing
    Given a portfolio with various liquidity profiles
    When the system performs liquidity risk assessment
    Then it should assess asset liquidity under normal conditions
    And it should perform liquidity stress testing scenarios
    And it should calculate liquidity coverage ratios
    And it should identify potential liquidity gaps
    And assessment should complete within 10 minutes

  Scenario: Operational risk quantification and modeling
    Given operational risk data including loss events and key risk indicators
    When the system performs operational risk assessment
    Then it should quantify operational risk using statistical models
    And it should identify key operational risk drivers
    And it should provide operational risk capital requirements
    And it should recommend operational risk mitigation strategies
    And assessment should complete within 20 minutes

  Scenario: Regulatory capital requirement calculation
    Given portfolio data and applicable regulatory frameworks
    When the system calculates regulatory capital requirements
    Then it should compute risk-weighted assets for credit risk
    And it should calculate market risk capital charges
    And it should include operational risk capital requirements
    And it should provide total capital adequacy ratios
    And calculation should complete within 15 minutes

  Scenario: Dynamic risk limit monitoring and alerting
    Given established risk limits and thresholds for the portfolio
    When the system monitors risk limits in real-time
    Then it should detect limit breaches immediately
    And it should generate appropriate alerts based on breach severity
    And it should recommend actions to bring risks within limits
    And it should track limit utilization trends over time
    And monitoring should operate continuously with sub-minute updates
