        - Stress testing scenarios
        - Monte Carlo simulations
        - Risk correlation analysis
        - Capital adequacy assessment
        
        Provide:
        - Overall risk score (0-100)
        - Risk breakdown by category
        - Scenario modeling results
        - Risk mitigation strategies
        - Capital requirements
        - Risk monitoring recommendations
        - Expected vs unexpected losses
